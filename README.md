#Windows 8 Application Image Generator for Logos and Tiles


----------


##Description
This plugin will take a standard image ( must by 150 x 150 ) and create all the versions needed in addition to creating a zip file for the user to download. You need to put in the background color
as this plugin will just take that standard image and resize down, but not up - to avoid distorting the image. Depending on the original logo, smaller versions	quality may not be ideal, requiring extra
work as resizing images can result in a loss of design fidelty.

##Install
Copy the winimages folder into your wordpress plugins directory.
Then activate the plugin via the admin panel. 

##To Use
Click on Tools - Win 8 Images
Put in the hex value of the background of the image and then upload or select image from your media server. Make sure this image is the 150x150 size.
A download zip link should appear right under the image, and all the images will be drawn to the screen to show the sizes and variations.
